## Tactical Sales Playbook

---

## Step 1: Identify Hot Prospects (2 hours)

### Where to Find Them:

**1. Google Maps (30 minutes):**
```
Search: "mobile car inspector [your city]"
Filter: 4+ stars, 20+ reviews
Target: Solo operators or small shops (not chains)

Signs of a good prospect:
✅ Active Google My Business (posting regularly)
✅ 50+ reviews (established, doing volume)
✅ Responds to reviews (cares about reputation)
✅ No fancy website (means they need help with tech/marketing)
```

**2. Facebook Marketplace (30 minutes):**
```
Search: Posts offering "pre-purchase inspection" or "car inspection"
Look for: People who post regularly (weekly)
Red flag: Only 1-2 posts (not serious)
```

**3. Craigslist Services (20 minutes):**
```
Search: "auto inspection" in services
Look for: Regular posters (check post history)
Good sign: Professional photos, detailed descriptions
```

**4. Lemon Squad Competitors (30 minutes):**
```
Google: "Lemon Squad alternative" + your city
Find: Independent inspectors advertising as alternatives
Why them: Already understand marketplace model, dissatisfied with 35% fee
```

**5. LinkedIn (10 minutes):**
```
Search: "Mobile auto inspector" + location
Filter: Active in last 30 days
Look for: Posts about their business, shares inspection content
```

## Step 2: The Qualifying Call (15 minutes per prospect)

### Script Template:

**Opening (30 seconds):**
"Hi [Name], I found your inspection business on Google. I'm launching an AI-powered platform for mobile inspectors. We're accepting 5 beta inspectors in [city] - are you currently doing 15+ inspections per month?"

**Qualifier Questions:**
1. "How many inspections do you do per month?"
   - Need: 15+ (serious volume)

2. "What do you use for marketing right now?"
   - Best answer: Google Ads, Facebook, struggling with it
   - Red flag: "Word of mouth only" (not growth-focused)

3. "Have you heard of Lemon Squad or similar platforms?"
   - Best answer: "Yes, but 35% is too high" (understands marketplace)
   - Good answer: "No, tell me more" (educatable)

4. "What's your biggest challenge right now?"
   - Best answer: "Getting more clients" or "Marketing" (we solve this)
   - Red flag: "Nothing, I'm fully booked" (doesn't need us)

**The Hook (if qualified):**
"We built an AI inspection platform that writes your reports in 5 minutes instead of 45. But the real value is the marketing engine - it automatically posts to your Google Business, generates content, and finds leads on Facebook Marketplace. We're accepting 5 beta inspectors in [city]. $2,997 to join. Interested in a demo?"

---

## Step 3: The Demo (30 minutes)

### What to Show (In Order):

**1. The Problem (5 minutes):**
Share screen of Lemon Squad website:
- "See this? They charge inspectors 35% per job."
- "That means on a $200 inspection, you only keep $130."
- "And they provide zero marketing help."

**2. Our Solution (10 minutes):**

**A. AI Report Generation:**
- Show sample inspection with photos
- "Normally this takes 45 minutes to write. Watch this."
- Run AI generation: Complete report in 2 minutes
- "That's 43 minutes saved. Per inspection."

**B. Marketing Automation:**
- Show dashboard with auto-generated content:
  - Google My Business post (auto-created)
  - Facebook posts (3-5 per week, automated)
  - SEO blog post (auto-written)
- "This runs 24/7. You do the inspection, we handle marketing."

**C. Lead Generation:**
- Show Facebook Marketplace bot demo:
  - Scrapes local car listings
  - Auto-sends inspection offer
  - "This generates 10-15 leads per week"

**3. The ROI Math (10 minutes):**

Pull up calculator:
```
Current state:
- 20 inspections/month at $200 = $4,000
- Time spent on reports: 15 hours
- Time spent on marketing: 10 hours
- Total: 25 hours wasted

With our platform:
- 20 inspections taking 5 minutes each = 1.7 hours
- 0 hours marketing (automated)
- Extra time = 23.3 hours
- At $200/inspection = 11 MORE inspections possible
- New total: 31 inspections/month = $6,200

ROI: $2,200 extra per month
Platform cost: $297/month + 20% of revenue ($1,240)
Net gain: $660/month + 23 hours back
```

**4. Scarcity Close (5 minutes):**
- "We're only accepting 5 inspectors in [city] for beta."
- "Currently 2 spots filled."
- "Beta pricing: $2,997 onetime + $297/month + 20% revenue share"
- "After beta: $4,997 + 35%"
- "Decision today?"

## Step 4: Handle Objections

### Objection 1: "That's expensive"

**Response:**
"You're right, $2,997 is a real investment. Let me ask - how much do you spend on marketing per month?"

[They say $0-500]

"This REPLACES that. Plus, if you do just 15 inspections next month at $200, that's $3,000 revenue. We take 20% = $600. You've made back $2,400 in month 1. The $2,997 pays for itself in 30 days."

**Show calculator:**
```
Month 1: 15 inspections × $200 = $3,000
Our 20%: -$600
Your take: $2,400
Upfront cost: $2,997
Net: -$597 (almost break-even month 1)

Month 2: 20 inspections (more from our leads) × $200 = $4,000
Our 20%: -$800
Monthly: -$297
Your take: $2,903
Net: +$2,306 profit (already ahead)
```

### Objection 2: "I need to think about it"

**Response:**
"Totally understand. What specifically do you need to think about - the price, the features, or whether you need it?"

[They explain]

**Then:**
"Here's the thing - we're only taking 5 inspectors in [city]. I have 2 other calls scheduled today. If I call you back tomorrow and the spots are filled, you'll be on the waitlist for 3-6 months. Can we at least reserve your spot with a $500 deposit while you think about it? Fully refundable for 7 days."

### Objection 3: "I'm already with Lemon Squad"

**Response:**
"Perfect! Then you already understand the marketplace model. Question - how do you feel about giving them 35% of every job?"

[They complain]

"Exactly. We're 20%. Plus YOU keep the client relationship, not us. You can use our platform for Lemon Squad jobs AND your own clients. It's not either/or."

### Objection 4: "Can I try it first?"

**Response:**
"We don't do free trials because we have a finite number of spots and need serious inspectors only. However, we do have a 30-day money-back guarantee. Do your first 10 inspections. If the AI reports aren't saving you hours and the leads aren't coming in, full refund. Zero risk."

---

## Step 5: The Close

### Three Closing Techniques:

**1. The Assumptive Close:**
"Okay, so that's $2,997 today to secure your spot. Do you want to use the Growth tier or jump straight to Professional?"

**2. The Alternative Close:**
"So we have two options - Growth at $997 + $147/month, or Professional at $2,997 + $297/month. Which feels right for your volume?"

**3. The Urgency Close:**
"I'm holding spot #3 for you right now. I have 2 more calls today for the remaining spots. Can we lock this in with your credit card?"

---

## Step 6: Payment & Onboarding

### Payment Options:

**Option 1: Full Payment**
- $2,997 via Stripe link
- Immediate access

**Option 2: Split Payment**
- $1,500 today
- $1,497 in 30 days
