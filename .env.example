# Backend API URL
# Production: https://auto-production-3041.up.railway.app
# Development: http://localhost:3001 (if running backend locally)
#
# IMPORTANT: API keys (Gemini, DeepSeek, OpenAI) are stored SECURELY on the backend.
# The frontend only needs the backend URL - never add API keys to the frontend!
