## 🔧 The Problem with $49.99 Unlimited

**Why you were right to be concerned:**

1. **Customer buys 1 month for $49.99**
   - Inspects 10 cars
   - Cancels subscription
   - You just gave away 10 inspections for $49.99 ($5 each)
   - Your per-report customers paid $19.99 each ($199 total)

2. **No free tier** = No funnel to attract new customers

3. **Cannibalization** = Why pay per report when unlimited is $49.99?
