## 5. Starting a New Inspection

### Step 1: Tap "+ New Inspection"

From your Dashboard, tap the **"+ New Inspection"** button.

### Step 2: Enter the VIN

You will see two sections:

**VIN Lookup:**
- Type or paste the **17-character VIN** into the field
- The VIN is usually found on:
  - The driver's side dashboard (visible through the windshield)
  - The driver's door jamb sticker
  - The vehicle registration or title
- Tap **"Decode VIN"**
- The system will automatically look up the year, make, and model

**Select Vehicle Type:**
- Choose the type that matches the vehicle:
  - **Standard (Cars/SUVs)** -- most passenger vehicles
  - **Electric Vehicle** -- Tesla, Rivian, any battery EV
  - **Commercial / 18-Wheeler** -- Class 6-8 trucks, semis, box trucks
  - **RV / Motorhome / Travel Trailer** -- any recreational vehicle
  - **Classic / Vintage / Collector** -- generally pre-1990 or collector vehicles
  - **Motorcycle** -- all two-wheeled motor vehicles

> **Why does vehicle type matter?** Each type loads a different checklist designed for that specific vehicle. A commercial truck has DOT compliance items. An RV has habitability and propane safety items. A classic car has authenticity verification items. Selecting the right type ensures you do not miss anything.

### Step 3: Begin the Inspection

After decoding the VIN and selecting the vehicle type, the full inspection form loads. You will see:

- The vehicle name and VIN at the top
- A vehicle type badge (e.g., "Commercial / 18-Wheeler")
- A **progress bar** that tracks your completion
- The **odometer reading** field
- All checklist categories for that vehicle type

---

## 6. The Inspection Checklist

### The Progress Bar

At the top of the inspection screen is a sticky progress bar that stays visible as you scroll. It shows:

- **Items completed** out of total (e.g., "12/45 items")
- **Photos taken** count
- **Fails** count (in red)
- **Concerns** count (in yellow)
- A **color-coded bar** that fills as you work:
  - Yellow = less than 50% done
  - Blue = 50-99% done
  - Green = 100% done

The bar also gives you **guidance text** that changes as you progress.

### Entering the Odometer Reading

The first thing to do is enter the odometer reading. Type the exact number shown on the vehicle's odometer (numbers only, no commas). For commercial vehicles, this may be a hubodometer reading.

### Working Through Checklist Items

Each checklist item has:

1. **A checkbox** -- tap to mark the item as inspected
2. **Condition buttons** -- tap one:
   - **Pass** (green) -- item is in acceptable condition
   - **Fail** (red) -- item has a problem that needs repair
   - **Concern** (yellow) -- item is marginal or approaching failure
   - **N/A** (gray) -- item does not apply to this vehicle
3. **Notes field** -- type any observations (e.g., "Left front tire at 3/32 tread depth")
4. **Add Photo button** -- attach a photo of this item
5. **Record Audio button** -- record a voice note about this item

### Best Practices for Marking Items

| Situation | What to Mark | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Everything looks good | **Pass** | Brake pads have 6mm remaining |
| Immediate repair needed | **Fail** | Tire has exposed cords |
| Needs attention soon | **Concern** | Brake pads at 3mm, will need replacing soon |
| Does not apply | **N/A** | "Fifth Wheel" on a straight truck with no trailer |

### Compliance / Specialized Sections

Depending on the vehicle type, you may see additional sections:

- **Commercial vehicles**: "DOT / FMCSA Compliance" section with federal inspection items including air brake tests, lighting requirements, and safety equipment
- **RVs**: "Habitability & Safety Systems" section covering propane, water, electrical, and safety devices
- **Classic vehicles**: "Authenticity & Provenance" section for numbers matching, originality assessment, and documentation

### Overall Notes

At the bottom of the checklist, there is an **"Overall Notes"** text box. Use this to write a general summary of the vehicle's condition, anything that stood out, or recommendations for the customer.

---

## 7. Taking Photos

Photos are critical evidence for your inspection report. They protect you, your customer, and build trust in your work.

### How to Take a Photo

1. Scroll to the checklist item you want to photograph
2. Tap **"Add Photo"**
3. Your phone's camera will open (or you can choose an existing photo)
4. Take the photo
5. The photo appears as a small thumbnail under that checklist item
6. You can add multiple photos to the same item

### How to Remove a Photo

- Hover over (or long-press on mobile) the photo thumbnail
- Tap the red **X** button that appears

### Photo Tips

- **Fails and concerns should always have a photo** -- this is your evidence
- Take photos of damage **before and after** you point it out
- For body damage, get **close-up** and **wide-angle** shots
- Make sure there is good lighting
- For undercarriage items, use your phone's flashlight
- Photos are automatically compressed to save data

### What Happens to Your Photos

- Photos are stored directly in the inspection report
- They appear in the final report next to each checklist item
- Your customer can see them in the PDF, email, or printed report
- During finalization, exterior photos are automatically sent to the AI for damage analysis

---

## 8. Recording Voice Notes

Sometimes it is faster to speak than type, especially when you are under a vehicle or your hands are dirty.

### How to Record a Voice Note

1. Scroll to the checklist item you want to add a note to
2. Tap the **"Record Audio"** button (microphone icon)
3. Your phone may ask for microphone permission -- tap **"Allow"**
4. Speak clearly about what you observe
5. Tap **"Stop"** when you are done
6. A green checkmark and **"Audio Saved"** will appear

### Tips for Voice Notes

- Speak clearly and mention the specific item you are inspecting
- Example: "Left front brake pad is at approximately 2 millimeters. Recommend immediate replacement. There is also scoring on the rotor."
- Voice notes are saved with the inspection and included in the report data

---

## 9. Advanced Fraud & Damage Detection

Before you finalize your report, you have access to powerful AI-powered analysis tools. These are optional but highly recommended.

### How to Access

1. Scroll down past the checklist and Overall Notes
2. Find the section labeled **"Advanced Fraud & Damage Detection"** with a purple "AI" badge
3. Tap the section to expand it

You will see three tabs: **Odometer Fraud**, **Flood Damage**, and **Body Damage AI**.

---

### 9.1 Odometer Fraud Detection

This tool analyzes wear patterns to detect if the odometer has been tampered with (rolled back).

**What to do:**

1. Tap the **"Odometer Fraud"** tab
2. You will see the claimed mileage displayed (from the odometer reading you entered)
3. Take and upload these photos:
   - **Pedal Wear** (REQUIRED) -- photograph the brake and gas pedals from above
   - **Steering Wheel** (optional) -- photograph the steering wheel showing wear
   - **Driver's Seat** (optional) -- photograph the driver's seat bolster area
4. Tap **"Analyze Odometer Fraud"**
5. Wait for the AI analysis (usually 10-30 seconds)

**Understanding Results:**

The system returns a risk level:

| Risk Level | What It Means |
|-----------|--------------|
| **LOW RISK** (green) | Wear patterns are consistent with claimed mileage |
| **MODERATE RISK** (yellow) | Some discrepancy between wear and claimed mileage |
| **HIGH RISK** (red) | Significant evidence of odometer tampering |

You will also see:
- **Fraud Probability** -- percentage likelihood of tampering
- **Estimated Mileage** -- what the AI thinks the true mileage is based on wear
- **Discrepancy** -- the difference between claimed and estimated mileage
- **Detailed Analysis** -- a written explanation of the wear patterns observed

---

### 9.2 Flood Damage Detection

This tool helps identify vehicles that have been through flooding or water damage, which sellers often try to conceal.

**What to do:**

1. Tap the **"Flood Damage"** tab
2. Check any physical indicators you observe:
   - Musty/mold smell in cabin
   - Water stains visible
   - Rust in unusual places
   - Foggy headlights/taillights
   - Carpet recently replaced
   - Electrical corrosion present
3. Upload photos:
   - **Carpet/Interior Photo** -- pull back floor mats and photograph the carpet and padding
   - **Engine Bay Photo** -- photograph the engine bay, focusing on wiring harnesses and connections
4. Tap **"Analyze Flood Damage"**

**Understanding Results:**

| Risk Level | What It Means |
|-----------|--------------|
| **LOW RISK** (green) | No significant flood indicators found |
| **MODERATE RISK** (yellow) | Some indicators present -- further investigation recommended |
| **HIGH RISK** (red) | Strong evidence of flood damage -- advise customer to walk away |

---

### 9.3 Body Damage AI Scan

This is the most advanced feature -- similar to the technology rental car companies use to scan vehicles for damage when you return them. Our AI analyzes photos of the vehicle's exterior to detect dents, paint mismatches, panel gap issues, hidden repairs, and accident evidence.

**What to do:**

1. Tap the **"Body Damage AI"** tab
2. Read the Photo Guide for best results
3. Upload up to **8 exterior photos** of the vehicle:
   - Front straight-on
   - Rear straight-on
   - Driver side profile
   - Passenger side profile
   - Front driver-side corner (3/4 view)
   - Front passenger-side corner (3/4 view)
   - Rear driver-side corner (3/4 view)
   - Rear passenger-side corner (3/4 view)
4. Add close-ups of any suspicious areas
5. Tap the purple **"Scan Photos for Damage"** button
6. Wait for AI analysis (may take 30-60 seconds for multiple photos)

**Understanding Results:**

The system provides:

- **Overall Severity**: None / Minor / Moderate / Severe
- **Accident Likelihood**: Unlikely / Possible / Likely
- **Repaint Detected**: Whether the AI sees evidence of repainting (color mismatch, orange peel, overspray)
- **Panel Gap Issues**: Whether gaps between body panels are uneven (indicates prior collision)

Individual findings list each area of concern with:
- **Area** -- where on the vehicle (e.g., "Left rear quarter panel")
- **Severity** -- Minor (blue), Moderate (yellow), or Severe (red)
- **Description** -- what the AI detected (e.g., "Paint color mismatch compared to adjacent panels, possible repaint after collision repair")

---

## 10. Using the Diagnostics Scanner

The Diagnostics tab lets you connect to the vehicle's onboard computer to read fault codes and live sensor data.

### Accessing Diagnostics

Tap the **"Diagnostics"** tab in the navigation bar.

### Choosing Your Scanner Mode

You will see four options:

| Mode | When to Use | What You Need |
|------|------------|---------------|
| **Pro Bluetooth** | Most vehicles (cars, SUVs, EVs) | OBDLink MX+ or compatible Bluetooth OBD-II adapter |
| **Heavy-Duty J1939** | Commercial trucks (Class 6-8) | 9-pin Deutsch J1939 adapter |
| **WiFi Scanner** | iPhone/iPad users | WiFi OBD-II adapter |
| **Manual Entry** | Classic cars, no scanner available | Nothing -- you type codes manually |

### Connector Guide

When you first open Diagnostics, you may see a **Connector Guide** specific to your vehicle type. This tells you:

- **What connector to look for** (16-pin OBD-II, 9-pin Deutsch, etc.)
- **Where it is located** on the vehicle
- **Which mode to select** in the app

This is especially helpful for RVs, which may have different connectors depending on the type:

| RV Type | Connector | Location |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| Gas Motorhome (Class A/C) | 16-pin OBD-II | Under dashboard, driver side |
| Diesel Pusher | 9-pin Deutsch (J1939) | Engine compartment or under dash |
| Travel Trailer / Fifth Wheel | No engine connector | No OBD scanning needed |

### Using the Bluetooth Scanner

1. Plug the OBD-II adapter into the vehicle's OBD port (usually under the dashboard, driver side)
2. Turn the vehicle's ignition to the ON position (engine can be off)
3. Select **"Pro Bluetooth"** in the app
4. The app will attempt to connect to the adapter
5. Once connected, you can:
   - **Read fault codes** (DTCs) -- see what check engine codes are stored
   - **View live data** -- watch real-time sensor readings (RPM, coolant temp, O2 sensors, etc.)
   - **Clear codes** (use with caution -- only clear after documenting)
6. For **Electric Vehicles**, this mode also includes battery health monitoring (State of Health)

### Using J1939 Heavy-Duty Mode

1. Connect the J1939 adapter to the truck's 9-pin diagnostic port
2. Select **"Heavy-Duty J1939"** in the app
3. This mode reads commercial truck-specific data:
   - SPN (Suspect Parameter Number) fault codes
   - FMI (Failure Mode Indicator) codes
   - DPF (Diesel Particulate Filter) status
   - DEF (Diesel Exhaust Fluid) system
   - Engine hours and idle time

### Manual Entry

If you do not have a scanner or the vehicle is too old for OBD:

1. Select **"Manual Entry"**
2. Type in any diagnostic codes you found through other means
3. The app will look up the code descriptions for you

---

## 11. Finalizing Your Report

When you have completed the checklist, added photos and notes, and optionally run fraud detection and diagnostics:

### Steps to Finalize

1. Review your progress bar -- ideally it should be at **100%**
2. Make sure the **odometer reading** is entered correctly
3. Tap **"Finalize & Generate Report"**

### What Happens During Finalization

The app runs several processes simultaneously (you will see status updates):

1. **Fetching vehicle history** -- checks for accidents, title issues, prior owners
2. **Checking safety recalls** -- queries the NHTSA recall database
3. **Checking theft & salvage records** -- verifies the vehicle is not stolen or salvage-titled
4. **Generating AI summary** -- artificial intelligence writes a professional summary of your findings
5. **Scanning for body damage** -- if you took exterior photos, the AI automatically analyzes them for damage
6. **Calculating vehicle grade** -- computes an overall grade (A through F) based on your inspection
7. **Saving report** -- stores the report for your records

This process typically takes 15-30 seconds. Do not close the app during this time.

---

## 12. Understanding the Vehicle Grade

Every report includes a **Vehicle Grade** from A to F. This is computed automatically from your inspection results.

### How the Grade is Calculated

The grade starts with your pass/fail ratio and applies deductions:

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| High pass rate | Higher score |
| Each failed item | -2 points |
| Each concern item | -0.5 points |
| Accident on record | -10 points |
| Salvage title | -20 points |
| Each open recall | -3 points (max -15) |

### Grade Meanings

| Grade | Score | Recommendation | What to Tell Your Customer |
|-------|-------|---------------|---------------------------|
| **A** | 90-100 | Strong Buy | "This vehicle is in excellent condition. I recommend purchasing." |
| **B** | 80-89 | Buy with Confidence | "This vehicle is in good condition with only minor issues." |
| **C** | 65-79 | Buy with Caution | "There are some issues. I recommend negotiating the price to cover repairs." |
| **D** | 50-64 | Negotiate Hard or Walk Away | "Significant problems found. If you proceed, negotiate aggressively." |
| **F** | 0-49 | Walk Away | "Too many issues. I recommend looking at other vehicles." |

### Estimated Repair Costs

The report also includes an estimated repair cost range based on:
- $350 average per failed item
- $120 average per concern item
- Range shows low estimate to 1.5x for high estimate

**Compliance section**: DOT / FMCSA Compliance including:
- Air brake system testing (governor cut-out, low air warning, static air loss rate)
- All lighting and reflective tape
- Safety equipment (fire extinguisher, warning triangles)
- USDOT number, MC authority, IFTA sticker

**Key focus areas:**
- Tire tread depth must meet federal minimums: 4/32" steer tires, 2/32" all others
- Slack adjuster stroke length must be within CMV limits
- Air loss rate: less than 2 PSI/min single vehicle, less than 3 PSI/min combination
- Frame rails -- check for cracks, bends, and weld repairs

**Diagnostics:** Use the **Heavy-Duty J1939** scanner mode with a 9-pin Deutsch adapter.

---

### RV / Motorhome / Travel Trailer

**Checklist sections**: Coach Exterior, Chassis/Frame, Life Support Systems, Interior Appliances, Cabin

**Compliance section**: Habitability & Safety Systems including:
- LP gas leak testing at every connection
- Water system pressure test
- Electrical system verification (shore power, GFCI outlets, generator)
- All safety detectors (smoke, CO, LP gas)

**Key focus areas:**
- **Roof condition** -- the single most expensive RV repair. Look for cracks, separating seams, and standing water
- **Sidewall delamination** -- press on sidewalls and listen/feel for sponginess
- **Water intrusion** -- check under every window, around every seam, and under all overhead cabinets
- **Slide-out mechanisms** -- extend and retract every slide-out, check seals
- **Propane system** -- use soapy water at every connection to check for leaks

**Diagnostics connector guide:**
- Gas motorhomes (Class A on Ford/Chevy chassis, Class C): Use standard **OBD-II Bluetooth** mode
- Diesel pushers (Class A on Freightliner/Spartan chassis): Use **Heavy-Duty J1939** mode
- Travel trailers and fifth wheels: **No engine diagnostics** -- these are towed and have no engine

---

### Classic / Vintage / Collector

**Checklist sections**: Body & Paint, Frame & Undercarriage, Engine & Drivetrain, Interior, Documentation

**Compliance section**: Authenticity & Provenance including:
- VIN/body/engine/transmission number matching
- Originality assessment for every major component
- Rust and body integrity at 8 critical areas
- Provenance documentation and chain of ownership

**Key focus areas:**
- **Numbers matching** -- verify engine, transmission, and body numbers match factory records. This dramatically affects value
- **Bondo/filler** -- use a magnet on body panels. If it does not stick, there is filler
- **Rust** -- check rocker panels, quarter panels, floor pans, trunk floor, and frame rails. Surface rust is cosmetic; structural rust is a deal-breaker
- **Documentation** -- original build sheet, window sticker, and continuous ownership history add significant value

**Diagnostics:** Most classic cars pre-date OBD. Use **Manual Entry** mode if you have diagnostic information.

---

### Motorcycle

**Checklist sections**: Controls & Electrical, Engine & Transmission, Frame/Wheels/Tires, Final Drive, Brakes & Suspension

**Key focus areas:**
- Tire age (check DOT date code on sidewall) -- motorcycle tires should be replaced after 5-6 years regardless of tread
- Fork seal leaks -- push down on the front forks and check for oil weeping
- Chain/belt tension and sprocket wear
- Frame damage -- sight down the frame from front and rear for straightness
- Clutch engagement feel and free play

---

## 18. Troubleshooting

### "Failed to decode VIN"
- Make sure you entered exactly 17 characters
- Check for common mistakes: letter O vs number 0, letter I vs number 1
- VINs never contain the letters I, O, or Q

### "Report generation failed"
- Check your internet connection
- Try again -- the AI service may have been temporarily unavailable
- If the problem persists, save your inspection progress and try finalizing later

### Photos are not uploading
- Make sure you granted camera/photo access to the browser
- Check that you have sufficient storage on your device
- Try taking a new photo instead of selecting from your gallery

### OBD scanner is not connecting
- Make sure the adapter is plugged securely into the OBD port
- Turn the vehicle's ignition to ON (not just accessory mode)
- Make sure Bluetooth is enabled on your phone
- Some vehicles require the engine to be running
- For WiFi adapters on iPhone: connect to the adapter's WiFi network first in phone Settings

### The app looks outdated or features are missing
- Close the app completely and reopen it
- Clear your browser cache (Settings > Safari/Chrome > Clear Cache)
- On iPhone: go to Settings > Safari > Clear History and Website Data
- The app updates automatically, but cached data may need to be cleared

### "Analysis failed" on fraud or damage detection
- This requires an internet connection and the AI service to be available
- Try again after a few moments
- Ensure photos are clear and not blurry
- The Body Damage AI works best with well-lit, exterior-focused photos

### Cannot sign in
- Double-check your email address for typos
- Use the "Forgot password?" link to reset your password
- Contact your administrator if your account may be suspended or expired
